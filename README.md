# Customer Feedback Analysis

# Project Overview

This project analyzes customer feedback, response times, and complaint resolution rates. The goal is to visualize the relationship between customer satisfaction and response times while also presenting data on complaint resolutions.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Dataset Description

The dataset consists of 100 customer reviews with the following fields:

* Customer_ID: Unique identifier for each customer

* Review Scores: A rating from 1 to 5 based on customer feedback

* Selected Reviews: Text-based customer feedback

* Purchase Category: Product category (Electronics, Clothing, Home Appliances)

* Response Time: The duration taken to respond to customer complaints

* Resolved: Whether the complaint was resolved (YES/NO)

# Visualizations

This project includes various visualizations to better understand customer feedback and complaint resolutions:

1. Bar Chart: Displays the distribution of customer review scores, with each review type represented in different colors.

2. Pie Chart: Shows the proportion of complaints that were resolved versus unresolved.

3. Scatter Plot: Analyzes the relationship between response time and customer satisfaction.
